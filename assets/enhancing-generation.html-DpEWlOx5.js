It combines a retrieval component, which searches for relevant documents or passages based on the input query, with a generative model that uses both the query and the retrieved information to produce more accurate and informative responses.</p><p>This approach allows the model to access up-to-date information and reduces reliance on memorized knowledge, improving performance on tasks like question answering and dialogue.</p><p>Similar or related techniques include:</p><ol><li><p><strong>REALM (Retrieval-Augmented Language Model)</strong>: Integrates a differentiable retrieval mechanism into the language model, enabling it to retrieve and attend to relevant documents during training and inference.</p></li><li><p><strong>FiD (Fusion-in-Decoder)</strong>: Retrieves documents and fuses them within the decoder of a sequence-to-sequence model to generate answers that are informed by the retrieved content.</p></li><li><p><strong>RETRO (Retrieval-Enhanced Transformer)</strong>: Augments transformer models by retrieving relevant text chunks from a database during inference to inform the generation process.</p></li><li><p><strong>DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval)</strong>: Uses dense vector representations to retrieve passages from a large corpus, often used in open-domain question answering systems alongside a reader model.</p></li><li><p><strong>OpenAI&#39;s WebGPT</strong>:
